Mirobot Chassis
===============

This repository contains the files that are needed to laser cut the chassis for Mirobot (http://mirobot.io). There are a few different files here:
 - mirobot_chassis_design.pdf - this is the main working file for Mirobot, but can't be used for laser cutting. It can be edited in Illustrator
 - mirobot_chassis_lasercut.pdf / .dxf / .svg - these files are the laser-cuttable outlines laid out for cutting as pdf, svg and dxf file types
 
These designs are currently designed to be cut from 3mm MDF board.

This repository is in a state of development, see the [releases](https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-chassis/releases) for known good snapshots. No guarantees are made - laser cut at your own risk!
